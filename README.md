# React Practice: useState & useEffect (Part 2)

This is a small React practice project focused on the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.

### ðŸ§ª What it does:
- Tracks button clicks using `useState`
- Dynamically updates button text after each click
- Updates the document title via `useEffect`
- Logs state changes to the console

### ðŸš€ Why this exists:
Part of my ongoing practice series to get hands-on experience with React hooks and state management. This is practice file #2.

No external libraries. Built with React only.
